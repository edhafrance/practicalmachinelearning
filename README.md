One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.


The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. The report contains the list of variables used after "cleaning" the data.  It also shows how cross validation was used and the expected out of sample error.

Based on the 20 scenarios, the athlete belongs to the following classes.
